## ‚ö†Ô∏è Digital Forensics:

### 7 Types of Digital Forensics:

1. **Criminal Forensics**
   
```
Criminal forensics is a type of computer forensics that is used in the investigation
of criminal activities such as cybercrime, hacking, identity theft, and other digital-related crimes.
Criminal forensics focuses on uncovering and preserving evidence that can be used to prosecute
the individuals responsible for these crimes.
```

2. **Civil Forensics**
   
```
Civil forensics is a type of computer forensics that is used in civil litigation such as
intellectual property disputes, contract disputes, and other civil proceedings. Civil forensics
focuses on uncovering and preserving evidence that can be used to support or refute a party‚Äôs
claims in a legal case.
```

3. **Incident response forensics**
   
```
Incident response forensics is a type of computer forensics that is used to investigate and respond
to security breaches and other incidents that impact the security and integrity of digital systems.
Incident response forensics focuses on identifying the cause of the incident, assessing the extent
of the damage, and developing a plan of action to prevent future incidents.
```

4. **Network forensics**
   
```
Network forensics is a type of computer forensics that focuses on the examination of network traffic and
system logs in order to uncover evidence of security breaches, cyberattacks, and other network-related incidents.
Network forensics involves the use of specialized tools and techniques to capture
and analyze network traffic, and to identify and track the source of the incident.
```

5. **Mobile forensics**
   
```
Mobile forensics is a type of computer forensics that focuses on the preservation, collection, examination,
 and analysis of data stored on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Mobile forensics is often
used in criminal investigations but can also be used in civil and incident response forensics.
```

6. **Live forensics**
   
```
Live forensics is a type of computer forensics that involves the collection and analysis of data from
a live computer system while it is still running. Live forensics is often used in incident response forensics,
and it is considered a critical component of the incident response process because
it can provide valuable insight into the state of a system at the time of an incident.
```
7. **Memory forensics**
   
```
Memory forensics is the branch of digital forensics that focuses on the examination of a computer‚Äôs volatile memory, or RAM.
The goal of memory forensics is to uncover information that is stored in memory and to use this information to assist in
the investigation of digital crimes and incidents. Memory forensics can be used to uncover information about system processes,
network connections, and malicious activity, and is considered a critical component of the digital forensics process because
it can provide valuable evidence that would otherwise be lost if a system were shut down.
Memory forensics requires specialized tools and techniques to capture and analyze data stored in memory,
and it is often used in conjunction with other forms of digital forensics to provide a
comprehensive understanding of a digital incident.
```

## üìÇ Three Phases of Forensics:

1. **Preservation**
   
```
The preservation phase involves the collection and preservation of evidence in a manner that ensures
its authenticity and integrity. This often involves making a forensic image of the evidence and
storing it in a secure location.
```

2. **Collection**
   
```
The collection phase involves the acquisition of evidence, which may involve the use of specialized tools
and techniques to capture data from the source. The collection phase is critical to the success of the investigation,
as it is important to collect as much evidence as possible in order to ensure a comprehensive examination.
```

3. **Examination**
   
```
The examination phase involves the analysis of evidence to uncover relevant information and identify potential sources..
