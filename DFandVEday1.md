## ‚ö†Ô∏è Digital Forensics:

### Mandatory Pre-Deployment Steps:

1. **Criminal Forensics**
   
```

Criminal forensics is a type of computer forensics that is used in the investigation
of criminal activities such as cybercrime, hacking, identity theft, and other digital-related crimes.
Criminal forensics focuses on uncovering and preserving evidence that can be used to prosecute
the individuals responsible for these crimes.

```

3. **Monitor Identification**
   
   Replace all underscore placeholders `_` with your actual monitor number:
   
   ```yaml
   # Example:
   monitor_number: 11  # Change the _ to 11
